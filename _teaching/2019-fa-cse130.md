Teaching Assistant for [Nadia Polikarpova]({{site.data.authors.Nadia_Polikarpova.uri}})'s programming languages course.
I ran a discussion section to reinforce knowledge on the Haskell programming
language and run test-prep.
As with any course, I held office hours, graded assignments/exams, and tended
the garden of Piazza questions.
