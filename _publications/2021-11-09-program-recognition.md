Program synthesizers can offer a user many candidate snippets to fit a
specification.
How should a user decide which snippet is the right one for them?
We introduce the problem of _program recognition_ in the context of program synthesis.
We argue recognition tasks are distinct from program comprehension, unique to synthesis, and under-explored.
We run an exploratory study on program recognition and share our findings.
