I am a 5th year PhD candidate at the University of California, San Diego working with [Nadia
Polikarpova]({{site.data.authors.Nadia_Polikarpova.uri}}).
I want to empower people to write better code, faster.
I focus on *type-guided program synthesis* and *human-computer interactions*.

I'm working on how to involve the user more effectively in synthesis interactions.
I have studied how programmers interact with *large language model* synthesizers (i.e., Copilot), to understand common techniques and shortfalls from using such a tool.
I have worked on Hoogle+, a type-driven, component-based synthesis tool for Haskell.
I have also worked to extend Synquid with examples to make synthesis with refinement types a little less painful.
