**⚠️Update⚠️** I am on the 💼industry job market💼 in H1 2024.
I am looking for research focused positions.
Get in touch with me by [email](mailto:hello@michaelbjames.com?subject=👋Hello from the internet👋).

I research and build human-AI collaborative programming tools.
I'm interested in how PL techniques, HCI methods, and AI approaches together
can automate and simplify interacting with code.

Large-language models are changing the face of programming,
with coders working hand-in-hand with AI-powered assistants.
Embracing the change these models offer has the potential to significantly
improve the day jobs of programmers.
I work on creating human-centric AI-programming assistants.
I am a 6th year PhD candidate at the University of California, San Diego working with [Nadia
Polikarpova]({{site.data.authors.Nadia_Polikarpova.uri}}),
hoping to find an employer with similar interests.


I'm working on how to involve the user more effectively in synthesis interactions.
I have studied how programmers interact with *large language model* synthesizers (i.e., Copilot),
to understand common techniques and shortfalls from using such a tool.
One project I have worked on improves how a coder validates an AI-suggestion for their task.
Another project I'm actively working on helps a programmer explore their task's design space with the assistance of a large-language model.
I have worked on Hoogle+, a type-driven, component-based synthesis tool for Haskell.
I have also worked to extend Synquid with examples to make synthesis with refinement types both more expressive and easier to use.
