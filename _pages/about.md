I am a fourth year PhD student at the University of California, San Diego working with [Nadia
Polikarpova]({{site.data.authors.Nadia_Polikarpova.uri}}).
I want to empower people to write better code, faster.
I focus on *type-guided program synthesis* and *human-computer interactions*.

I'm working on how to involve the user more effectively in synthesis interactions.
I have worked on Hoogle+, a type-driven, component-based synthesis tool for Haskell.
I have also worked to extend Synquid with examples to make synthesis with refinement types a little less painful.
